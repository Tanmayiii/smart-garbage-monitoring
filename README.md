# 🚀 Smart Waste Management System 🌍
## 📌 Overview
The Smart Waste Management System is an IoT-based solution that automates waste collection monitoring. It utilizes sensors and communication modules to track waste levels in bins and send real-time updates to a cloud-based system, optimizing waste collection efficiency.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ Real-time Monitoring: Detects waste levels using an ultrasonic sensor.
- ✅ Automated Alerts: Sends notifications when the bin is full.
- ✅ GPS Tracking: Uses a GSM Neo-6M module to provide location data.
- ✅ Remote Access: Can be monitored via a web dashboard or mobile app.
- ✅ Energy Efficient: Uses an ESP8266 microcontroller with optimized power consumption.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU – Microcontroller for data processing
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – Detects waste levels
- Servo Motor (SG90) – Controls bin lid automation
- RFID MFRC522 – Enables authorized access to waste bins
- GSM Module (Neo-6M) – Sends location data for optimized routing
- Power Supply (5V DC) – External power for stable performance

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Integrate Machine Learning for waste collection predictions.
- Enhance Cloud-based Analytics for better data insights.
- Implement Mobile App Support for better accessibility.
